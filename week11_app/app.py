# app.py — DATS 6401 Week 11 live demo: consuming an API
#
# Embedded in the Week 11 chapter through dats6401/_live_app_week11.qmd, and
# built for that setting on the same rules as demo_app/:
#
#   * every interaction is a click-then-redraw, with no long-running loops --
#     Streamlit Community Cloud's free tier handles that workload well
#   * three dependencies, so a cold start after the app sleeps stays short
#   * no bundled data files: the whole point is that the data arrives over HTTP
#   * laid out for a ~600px iframe -- controls on top, no sidebar
#
# It is Block 2 made clickable. Four things are on display: query parameters as
# the interface, the three checks on a response, caching keyed on arguments,
# and what the page does when the call fails.
